# Parking-lot

Here is a Design of a parking lot management system. The parking lot has 15 slots, 10 slots can only accommodate
small vehicles and the rest of the 5 can accommodate both small and bigger vehicles.

The parking fee for the first 10 slots is 60 USD (Please use a local currency
equivalent if you prefer to do so) and the parking fee for the last 5 slots is 100 USD. The
maximum parking time is 30 minutes, after which an extra 15 USD is charged for every
extra hour spent in the parking.

The solution represents a booking mechanism, once a slot is booked, it is marked as booked on the booking screen so no other car can
occupy it till it is made free. It also shows the total charge owed to cars that are exiting a parking slot.
